Scenario:Imagine you are building a home automation system that can control various devices in your home, such as lights, fans, and smart locks. You want to implement a remote control that can execute different commands to control these devices. Each command corresponds to a specific action, like turning on a light or locking a door. The Command pattern will help you encapsulate these actions as objects.
